# Ember.js + Stencil.js components

This demo demonstrates how to use Web Components created with [stencil.js](stenciljs.com)
in an Ember app. This covers:

* Packaging/building
* data binding

## Requirements

* Node 6.x + npm +5.x

## Install

* Clone the repo
* `npx lerna bootstrap`

## Usage

* `npm start`
* Open your browser to `http://localhost:4200`

# What's in it?

* `packages/ember-demo` is just the demo app using the components.
  * See `app/controllers/application.js` and `app/templates/application.hbs` for the interesting part
* `packages/ember-cli-stencil` is an unpublished addon that simplifies the packaging of Stencil components.
  * **tl;dr;** it's just nothing but copy/paste commands. Will be published soon(ish)
* `packages/my-stencil-web-components` is a small repo of 2 web components built with Stencil.js. If you know Stencil, nothing fancy here.

The applcation in itself doesn't do much:
* You can click on the red text to change the greeting from Ember
* You can click on thr button to toggle the usage of the Components slots from Ember
* It's just a demo, right? ðŸ˜…
